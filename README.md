# Happy-Mind-App
CA for Object Oriented Programming class, November 2023.
Created by Aneta Kotas and [Breda Logan](https://github.com/blogan1974).

Our project is dedicated to advancing the United Nations' 3rd Sustainable Development Goal, which centres on promoting Good Health and Well-Being. Our specific focus lies in nurturing positive mental health by providing activities that have the potential to enhance well-being. The core idea is to offer users personalised suggestions for activities that can contribute to improved mental health, especially during moments when self-motivation may be a challenge. 

Activities that promote mental health, engage in physical wellness, and foster social interactions play important roles in maintaining mental well-being and so the App with focus on these 2 areas which will be split into 2 distinct sections. 

The user will be able to select the type of activity they want to engage in, e.g. Specific Mental Health Activities, Physical Activities.

Engaging in regular physical activity is known to have a positive impact on mental well-being. When users opt for physical activities, they will have the opportunity to select from a variety of options including cardio, toning, or stretching exercises. They will then return a recommended activity, along with its suggested duration and a brief description. Additionally, users will have the flexibility to switch to a different activity if they so choose.

Another section in the HappyMind application is gratitude list â€“ proven method of shifting your thoughts to the positive experiences in your life, which leads to several positive benefits to one's well-being. 

In this activity user will be able to create a list with things they are grateful for (or simply with things they are happy about). User will be able to add new entries to the list, delete chosen entries and search for entries which include a certain word. Additionally, user will have access to a progress bar signifying number of daily entries and how many entries they have left to reach that daily goal. Person engaging with the application would be able to set that goal and change it accordingly to their preferences.
